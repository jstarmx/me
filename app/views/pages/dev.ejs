    <p>I'm a design-focused front end developer at On the Beach. My bag is writing readable, resuable and tested HTML, CSS and Javascript that serves up highly usable and accessible user interfaces. Having spent a good number of years working as a designer who codes, I have a strong eye for visuals and UX that works for users. Now that I'm a full-time coder I can apply that with a strong technical grounding and I'm constantly striving to learn and improve my skillset.</p>
    <p>I'm a firm beliver that ability, enthusiasm and ethos are more important than knowledge of particular technologies. Nonetheless, here are some of my favourites to use at work and at home:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>React</li>
      <li>Jest</li>
      <li>Sass</li>
      <li>Git</li>
      <li>Webpack</li>
      <li>Node</li>
      <li>Yarn</li>
      <li>HTML5</li>
      <li>Ruby</li>
    </ul>
